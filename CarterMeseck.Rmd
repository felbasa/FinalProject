## Finding Average Person vs Average Person who has had a stroke.

summary(data)
table(data$gender)
table(data$Residence_type)
table(data$ever_married)
table(data$work_type)
table(data$smoking_status)


## Average Person is 43(.23) years old.
## Average Person has 5% chance to have heart disease
## Average Person has 28.89 BMI
## Average Person has 106.15 Glucose level
## Average Person has 9.7% chance to have hypertension
## Average person is a female
## Average pesron has never smoked or unknown
## Average person has a 4.9% chance to have had a stroke.
## Average person lives in an urban residence
## Average person is privately employed
## Average person has been married

## Average Stroker is 67(.71) years old.
## Average Stroker has 19.1% chance to have heart disease
## Average Stroker has 30.5 BMI
## Average Stroker has 134.6 Glucose level
## Average Stroker has 28.7% chance to have hypertension
## Average Stroker is a female (However the average person from our dataset was a female so not surprising)
## Average Stroker has never smoked, second place being formerly smoked as opposed to unknown in non smokers.
## Average Stroker has a 100% chance to have had a stroke.
## Average Stroker lives in an urban residence, however the difference is only 9 so I wouldn't say this is statistically significant.
## Average Stroker is privately employed
## Average Stroker has been married

noSmoke


summary(noSmoke)


## Average age of someone who has smoked or smoked in the past is 51.24
## Average age of someone who hasn't smoked is 46.74
## There is about an average increase of 2% in chance that someone who smoked will have had a stroke.
