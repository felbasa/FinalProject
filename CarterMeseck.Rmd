## Finding Average Person vs Average Person who has had a stroke.

summary(data)
table(data$gender)
table(data$Residence_type)
table(data$ever_married)
table(data$work_type)
table(data$smoking_status)


## Average Person is 43(.23) years old.
## Average Person has 5% chance to have heart disease
## Average Person has 28.89 BMI
## Average Person has 106.15 Glucose level
## Average Person has 9.7% chance to have hypertension
## Average person is a female
## Average pesron has never smoked or unknown
## Average person has a 4.9% chance to have had a stroke.
## Average person lives in an urban residence
## Average person is privately employed
## Average person has been married

strokes <- data[which(data$stroke == 1 & data$bmi != 'N/A'), ]

summary(strokes)
table(strokes$gender)
table(strokes$Residence_type)
table(strokes$ever_married)
table(strokes$work_type)
table(strokes$smoking_status)

## Average Stroker is 67(.71) years old.
## Average Stroker has 19.1% chance to have heart disease
## Average Stroker has 30.5 BMI
## Average Stroker has 134.6 Glucose level
## Average Stroker has 28.7% chance to have hypertension
## Average Stroker is a female (However the average person from our dataset was a female so not surprising)
## Average Stroker has never smoked, second place being formerly smoked as opposed to unknown in non smokers.
## Average Stroker has a 100% chance to have had a stroke.
## Average Stroker lives in an urban residence, however the difference is only 9 so I wouldn't say this is statistically significant.
## Average Stroker is privately employed
## Average Stroker has been married

### Average age of each smoking status


```{r}


## Find average age of people by smoke group.
smoke <- data[data$smoking_status == "smokes" | data$smoking_status == "formerly smoked", ]

summary(smoke)

noSmoke <- data[data$smoking_status == "never smoked", ]

summary(noSmoke)


## Average age of someone who has smoked or smoked in the past is 51.24
## Average age of someone who hasn't smoked is 46.74
## There is about an average increase of 2% in chance that someone who smoked will have had a stroke.
## Almost double chance of someone to have heart disease that smokes vs non smoke
## 40.6% more likely for a smoker to have a stroke vs non smoker.

data %>% group_by(smoking_status) %>%
  mutate(age_avg = mean(age)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = `smoking_status`, y=`age_avg`, fill = `smoking_status`)) + geom_bar(stat="identity", position = "dodge") + 
     ggtitle("Percentage of Strokes in Relation to Smoking Status")


```
```{r}
## Looking into female vs male to see if there are any discrepancies there.
table(strokes$gender)
## 120 Females have had a stroke and 89 Males have. Proportion is 1.35
table(data$gender)
## 2994 Females and 2115 Males in the dataset. Proportion is 1.42

## Proportion of females to males is lower in people that have had a stroke, but not significant enough to extract any  meaning.

male <- data[data$gender == "Male", ]
female <- data[data$gender == "Female",]

summary(male)
table(male$ever_married)
table(male$work_type)
table(male$smoking_status)
# 5% chance for Male to have a stroke
# Avg male age for dataset is 42.5
# Avg Male hypertension is 10.5%
# Avg Male Heart disease 7.8%
# Avg Male glucose level is 109
# 56.4% Chance for Male to not have been married
# 55.3% Chance for Male to work Private
# 47.1% Chance for Male to never have smoked

summary(female)
table(female$ever_married)
table(female$work_type)
table(female$smoking_status)
# 4.7% chance for Female to have a stroke
# Avg Female age for dataset is 43.8
# Avg Female hypertension is 9.2%
# Avg Female Heart disease 3.8%
# Avg Female glucose level is 104.1
# 49.6% Chance for Female to not have been married
# 58.6% Chance for Female to work Private
# 57% Chance for Female to never have smoked

# From this we can tell that in this dataset, females are much less likely to have heart disease, have been married, and have smoked.
